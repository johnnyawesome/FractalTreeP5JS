Hint: This Fractal Tree is written in P5JS, but [I also have a more simple version, I wrote a while ago, written in Processing](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/FractalTree)

Also, there is a second verison with a [nicer coloring available for this P5JS project, right here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/FractalTreeLeafsP5JS).

## Recursion

This tree uses recursion to get it's fractal form.
